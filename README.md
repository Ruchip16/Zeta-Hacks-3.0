Even in modern times, the fundamental pillar of financial literacy remains evergreen, just with a touch of technology to it. Lessons for saving and finance management 
remain crucial but require far more interaction and frequent touch than the older days. 

With this traditional ideology and the power of technology, we came up with the idea of ‘GenMoney’, a mobile application for teenagers to manage their finances, 
set goals for savings, and learn the fundamentals of how money works and all of this, at the tap of a finger. 

**GenMoney** is a mobile application designed by keeping in mind the gen-Z and the transformations in the aspects of money management along with the traditional 
evergreen methodologies. We at GenMoney, aim to provide teenagers a real experience of how is it like to have a bank account with features like **Savings Account**, 
**KYC Authentication**, **Interests/Rewards**, **Online Banking** (similar to UPI) and much more. 
We believe that teenage is the time when an individual gets a taste of the reality of life and needs to prepare oneself for the journey ahead. 

*The major objective of the application is to help teenagers become financially literate and soon become financially independent*. 

Zeta Hacks acts as the perfect opportunity to bring this dream to reality and take our first step to reach the milestone of 10million financially educated Teenagers.
